# Digital Image Processing using Java

This repository presents a comprehensive exploration of digital image processing techniques implemented in Java. As an essential domain within computer vision, digital image processing involves the manipulation and analysis of images to extract valuable information or enhance visual features.

## Key Features

- **Java Implementation:** The entire project is coded in Java, providing a platform-independent solution.
- **Diverse Techniques:** Explore a range of image processing techniques, including filtering, transformations, and feature extraction.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** Intuitive and user-friendly functions for image input, processing, and output.

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine:

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/digital-image-processing-using-java.git
   cd digital-image-processing-java
   ```

2. **Run the Application:**
   - Open the project in your preferred Java development environment.
